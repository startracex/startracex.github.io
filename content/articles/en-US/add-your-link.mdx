title: Add Your Link
description: Add your link to this website
---

My website has a new page for friend links, and you can also add your own website link.

You need to fork this repository, then add your link to `src/app/[lang]/(content)/links/_data.ts`, and open a PR.
When adding a link, place the new link before Example, so all new links will be sorted by the order of addition, with Example at the end.

A link format is as follows:

```js
{
  name: {
    "en-US": "Example",
    "zh-CN": "示例",
  },
  description: {
    "en-US": "Example website",
    "zh-CN": "示例网站",
  },
  url: "https://example.com",
  preview: "/placeholder.svg",
  languages: ["English"],
}
```

`preview` is the preview image of the link. You can take a screenshot and save it in the `public` directory, or use your own image hosting service. The display ratio is 8:5.

If you don't want to use this method, you can also contact me directly and provide the above information, and I will add it for you.

After adding, during the next deployment, the link will be displayed on the [/en-US/links](/en-US/links) page.

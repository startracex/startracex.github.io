## Rebirth

When I first started working on this website, I was actually trying to make a full-screen theme switcher - the idea popped into my head suddenly, and I wanted to implement it right away.

My vision for this switcher was: it would include ternary theme modes - light, dark, and auto.

In its initial state, the page would display a split view in "auto theme": the left half showing the light theme, and the right half showing the dark theme. When you click on a theme, that theme would expand to fill the entire screen; clicking again would return to the split view.

But just having a theme switcher felt too simplistic, and you could barely notice the switching effect. So I put my personal introduction below, making it change along with the theme.

With that, it looked like a proper personal website. I took the opportunity to officially turn it into one.

## Technology Selection

The new website uses `Next.js` (in fact, the old one did too), after all, it's the first front-end framework I came into contact with.

When I built my first website back then, I was completely new to front-end development. At that time, Next.js was still version 12, which didn't support app routing yet, and all pages had to be placed in the pages directory.

Before that, I had barely written any JavaScript, and knew nothing about TypeScript. I was basically a beginner who only knew HTML and CSS.

Although I've also been exposed to React, I don't know much about JavaScript. I'm quite troubled by the JSX syntax. At that time, many tutorials were still focused on React class components. The first time I wrote a functional component was also in Next.js.

Fortunately, many code examples in the Next.js documentation came with TypeScript versions, and it was through Next.js that I gradually embarked on my TypeScript learning journey.

## Construction Process

The project source code was created using create-next-app, with Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and path aliases enabled during creation, these were configured when I first started working on the theme switcher.

In terms of components, a small portion used Shadcn-ui and the Godown library I wrote before, but most were rewritten.

For the documentation feature, I used Fumadocs. I discovered this library when planning to add documentation pages; it has a lot of useful encapsulations, saving me from having to handle Markdown files myself, which is very convenient.

In terms of deployment, the website currently has two deployment sources: one on Vercel, and the other on GitHub Pages. However, GitHub Pages can't deploy back-end programs, so the one there uses static site generation (SSG) with export output.

## Issues Encountered

During the construction process, I encountered a rather hidden issue, specifically in the deployment phase of standalone output.

I think few people would use standalone output - either use export output to deploy static pages, or use the default build to deploy to a regular host.

With standalone build, you can start the web server via `node .next/standalone/server.js`, though I haven't researched the differences between it and the default build.

I tried configuring this output method at the time, but soon ran into a problem: local packages like `react`, `react-dom`, `next`, and `typescript` all became empty directories!

At first, I thought I had accidentally deleted the packages or that there was a problem with the package manager cache, so I had to delete the cache and redownload the packages.

But after experiencing this three times in a row, I realized what was wrong: Next.js was clearing the local packages along with the .next directory - because there are some symbolic links in the .next directory that point exactly to these cleared packages.

It was obvious that Next.js had a bug in handling the clearing of the output directory or file deletion.

Fortunately, I quickly found the source of the problem, fixed it, created a pull request, and it has now been merged into the canary version

As a technical novice, being able to contribute code to such a top framework, even if it's just a small change, made me excited a lot.

Now, there's no need to worry about anyone else having their local packages cleared by Next.js when running a build, just like me.

## Future Plans

I'm a complete novice when it comes to website operation, and I'm not even sure if this website will be abandoned by me after a while like the previous one. But I'll try to update more content and gradually fill it up.

If you have any questions about the content mentioned on the website, you can find my contact information through the contact module in the header - feel free to ask me anything.
